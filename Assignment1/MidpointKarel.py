----------------------
When you finish writing it, MidpointKarel should
leave a beeper on the corner closest to the center of 1st Street
(or either of the two central corners if 1st Street has an even
number of corners).  Karel can put down additional beepers as it
looks for the midpoint, but must pick them up again before it
stops.  The world may be of any size, but you are allowed to
assume that it is at least as tall as it is wide.

    # a special case and the loop ends when faced with such condition with Karel at the midpoint with a beeper. For
    # other cases having a world with 3 or more corners we have constructed a loop of commands to first find the
    # midpoint using the beeper and then removing the excess beepers while returning to the midpoint position.
